# Face Mask Detection 
In this project, the YOLO World Model was used to detect face masks, and this image shows how the YOLO World Model works in detecting objects.

## proposed system architecture 
The project aims to efficiently and quickly detect and identify the face mask worn by people while reducing computational cost.
## Project Aims 
* The Yolo World model is applied to detect face masks because it is fast and accurate and works to reduce the computational cost while maintaining accuracy.
